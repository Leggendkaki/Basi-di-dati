	     precede the file input field, and its value is the
	     maximum filesize accepted by PHP. Fooling this setting on
	     the browser side is quite easy, so never rely on files
	     with a greater size being blocked by this feature. The
	     PHP settings for maximum-size, however, cannot be
	     fooled. This form element should always be used as it
	     saves users the trouble of waiting for a big file being
	     transferred only to find that it was too big and the
	     transfer failed.
